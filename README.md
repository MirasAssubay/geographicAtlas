# Advanced 

Only one of these bonuses will be applied: 
1. Used only programmatic layout
2. Skeleton views used, it's seen in video (DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter added to demonstrate)
3. Make the UI look and feel good for all the screen sizes including iPads - used autolayout and constraints
4. Make the expand/collapse feature for CountriesList animated, with no UI bugs, however there is small bug when cell is expanded
labels smoothly move up
6. Add the images caching and reuse them from cache (don’t download any image twice) - Added cachedCountries for API to be called 
only once per section
8. Use “nice” naming (common readability, self-documenting code)
9. Follow any of the architectures (MVC, MVVM, VIPER etc.) - MVC used in this project
10. Add basic non-UI tests coverage - Added unit tests for CountryDetailView, nevertheless it fails every time 
11. Write safe code, leave no possibility of crashes (correct optionals, array indices handling etc.) - Used force unwrap only once
12. Capital coordinates - tappable, shown in the video
13. Add the pushes feature - was not added, since pushes requires apple developer enrollment
